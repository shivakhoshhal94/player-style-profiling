# ⚽ Football Player Clustering

This project performs **unsupervised clustering of professional football players** using their match statistics (e.g. passes, tackles, xG, xA), specifically focusing on **per 90-minute contributions**. The aim is to **group players into meaningful playstyle roles** without supervision, using real player performance data.

## 📌 What Each File Does

### `main.py`
This is the main script that runs the entire pipeline:
1. Loads the player dataset
2. Computes per-90 statistics (normalizing for minutes played)
3. Clusters players using KMeans
4. Saves the result to `clustered_players.csv`

### `src/data_loader.py`
Contains a simple function:
```python
load_data(path)
```
It loads the dataset using Pandas. The default path is:
```
data/archive_3/2023-2024/combined_players_stats.csv
```

### `src/feature_engineering.py`
Defines `compute_per90(df)` to generate per-90-minute versions of:
- Passes
- Tackles
- Key passes
- Expected Goals (xG)
- Expected Assists (xA)

### `src/clustering_model.py`
Defines the clustering function:
```python
cluster_players(df, features, n_clusters)
```
- Scales features with `StandardScaler`
- Clusters players using `KMeans`
- Returns the dataframe with a new `cluster` column

---

## 📊 Example Features Used for Clustering
- `passes_per90`
- `tackles_per90`
- `key_passes_per90`
- `xG_per90`
- `xA_per90`

---

## 📁 Output
The result is saved to:
```
clustered_players.csv
```
Each player is tagged with a `cluster` ID. You can explore which players share similar styles statistically.

---

## 🧠 Goal
This project helps demonstrate:
- Feature engineering with sports data
- Unsupervised learning (KMeans)
- Workflow modularization in Python

---

## 📎 Note
Make sure the dataset exists at the correct path:
```
data/archive_3/2023-2024/combined_players_stats.csv
```

---

## 🔜 Ideas to Extend
- Add UMAP or PCA for cluster visualization
- Use DBSCAN or Agglomerative clustering
- Label each cluster (e.g. "Ball Winner", "Playmaker")
- Combine with salary data to find undervalued players



## 🧠 Best Position Recommendation (Branch: best_position)

This branch introduces a smart system to analyze and recommend the most suitable playing positions for soccer players based on their seasonal performance data. The goal is to support coaches and analysts in:

    🧩 Understanding player tendencies

    🔁 Re-evaluating position assignments

    🛠️ Designing personalized preseason training plans

## 📌 Project Idea

Modern football often demands flexibility in formations and player roles. Using detailed player stats, this system learns what features (e.g., xG, xAG, progression metrics) characterize different positions — Defender (DF), Midfielder (MF), Forward (FW), Goalkeeper (GK) — and predicts the top-3 roles each player may be best suited for.

This helps identify:

    Players who are well-positioned (their current role matches predicted best fit)

    Players who are a good fit, but not optimized

    Players who may need a role reassessment for improved impact

## 📊 Methodology

    Data Source: A combined dataset of 2023-2024 player statistics.

    Feature Engineering: Metrics like xG, xAG, progressive passes/carries, per90 stats.

    Modeling: A RandomForestClassifier predicts positions using labeled training data.

    Top-3 Position Inference: For each player, the top-3 predicted positions are generated.

    Evaluation Logic:

        Best Positioned: Actual position is top-1 predicted.

        Good Fit: Actual position is in top-3.

        Consider Review: Actual position is not in top-3 → flag for managerial discussion.

    Output:

        CSV file (position_recommendations.csv) with player name, real position, top-3 predictions, and assessment.

        Charts: Confusion Matrix, Top-3 Position Frequency, Assessment Distribution.

        🖥️ Optional: Streamlit Dashboard for interactive review.

## 🎯 Use Case

This tool is most useful before a new season begins:

    Coaches can rethink tactical roles.

    Players can be trained for secondary or emerging positions.

    Management can make data-informed rotation and recruitment decisions.
