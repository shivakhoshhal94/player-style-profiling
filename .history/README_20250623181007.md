## 🧠 Best Position Recommendation (Branch: `best_position`)

This branch introduces an intelligent position recommendation system designed to analyze and suggest the most suitable playing roles for football players, based on their performance data across the season.

### 🔍 Objective

Modern football demands adaptability and role fluidity. This module helps:

- Understand player tendencies using objective stats  
- Re-evaluate position assignments to maximize performance  
- Tailor preseason training plans based on data-driven insights  

### 🧠 How It Works

We trained a `RandomForestClassifier` on key performance features such as:

- Age, xG, xAG  
- Per-90 stats: Goals, Assists, Progressive Passes/Carries  
- Overall performance metrics  

Each player's actual position is compared with the **top 3 predicted positions** generated by the model. This enables a flexible analysis of player fit.

### ✅ Evaluation Categories

We use smart evaluation logic to interpret results:

- **Best Positioned**: The actual position is the top-1 predicted  
- **Good Fit**: The actual position appears within the top-3  
- **Consider Review**: The actual position does not appear in top-3  

This respects modern scenarios where players have **multiple roles** (e.g., "DF, MF"). Our system accounts for these cases by parsing multi-position strings when evaluating match quality.

### 📁 Output

- `position_recommendations.csv`: Player name, actual position(s), top 3 predictions, and classification result  
- Charts:  
  - Confusion Matrix for top-1 prediction accuracy  
  - Distribution of position recommendations  
  - Assessment breakdown (Best/Good/Review)  

### 💡 Practical Use Case

Before a new season:

- **Coaches** can refine tactical roles  
- **Players** can adapt during preseason to new responsibilities  
- **Management** gets insight into potential under- or mis-utilized players
