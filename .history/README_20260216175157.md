# ⚽ Football Player Style Profiling using Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to profile professional football players based on attacking and progression statistics.

The objective is to group players into statistically similar archetypes using match performance data, without relying on predefined roles or position labels.

By clustering players based on per-90 performance metrics, the model identifies natural performance segments that can support scouting and comparative analysis.

## Problem Statement

Traditional football role classification relies on positional labels (e.g., midfielder, forward), which often fail to capture stylistic differences between players.

This project explores the following question:

> Can players be segmented into meaningful performance-based groups using only statistical output?

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains professional football player statistics for the 2023–2024 season.

Selected features used for clustering:

- `xG_per90` — Expected Goals per 90 minutes  
- `xAG_per90` — Expected Assists per 90 minutes  
- `progressive_carries`  
- `progressive_passes`  
- `progressive_runs`  

Missing values in these features were removed prior to clustering to ensure clean input data.

## Methodology

### 1. Feature Preparation
- Renamed relevant statistical columns for clarity.
- Selected attacking and progression-based metrics.
- Removed rows with missing feature values.

### 2. Feature Scaling
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.
- Ensured equal weighting across metrics before clustering.

### 3. Clustering
- Applied **KMeans clustering** with 6 clusters.
- Used a fixed random seed (`random_state=42`) for reproducibility.

### 4. Visualization
- Visualized clusters using a 2D scatter plot of `xG_per90` vs `xAG_per90`.

## Results

### Cluster Distribution

| Cluster | Player Count |
|----------|--------------|
| 4 | 1813 |
| 1 | 774 |
| 2 | 414 |
| 3 | 350 |
| 0 | 196 |
| 5 | 5 |

### Key Observations

- A dominant cluster represents the majority of players with moderate attacking contribution.
- A very small cluster (5 players) represents statistical outliers with exceptionally high creative output.
- The model effectively isolates extreme performers from the general population.
- Segmentation reflects natural performance differences rather than predefined positional roles.
